## Assignment 1
I am taking this course as an introduction to JavaScript and it's application to the front-end of websites. I am currently taking this class concurrently with WEB 250 which is using NodeJS on the back-end. I have been waiting to dive into JavaScript fully and this semester is going to be full of it. I plan to use JavaScript in the future to make my website modern, robust, and interactive. I know it adds a lot of capability to websites and is one of the 3 basic languages of the front-end. The past, present, and future of websites are dependent on a web developer's ability to use these languages in conjunction, JavaScript being one of the critical ones. 

## Assignment 2
This assignment taught me how to integrate JavaScript into my page while using buttons. Before I knew how to use window.alert but found this rather intrusive and annoying. Not only will integrating the buttons on the page be more useful in the future, but it also allows me to customize the experience a lot more by changing the HTML and CSS.  I also learned more about managing the functions that I have in my JavaScript. Initially, I was trying to just run everything in order from top to bottom with no functions splitting anything apart. When I used the functions the processing of the JavaScript made a lot more sense and functioned better. In the future, I will 100% be using JavaScript like this in order to customize the user experience of a website that I design.
