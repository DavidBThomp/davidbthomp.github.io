## Assignment 1

I am taking this course as an introduction to JavaScript and it's application to the front-end of websites. I am currently taking this class concurrently with WEB 250 which is using NodeJS on the back-end. I have been waiting to dive into JavaScript fully and this semester is going to be full of it. I plan to use JavaScript in the future to make my website modern, robust, and interactive. I know it adds a lot of capability to websites and is one of the 3 basic languages of the front-end. The past, present, and future of websites are dependent on a web developer's ability to use these languages in conjunction, JavaScript being one of the critical ones.
