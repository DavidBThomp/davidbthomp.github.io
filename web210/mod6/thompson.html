                <p>The box and one defense is a tactic that involves zone defense and incorporates a man-on-man action.
                    The
                    main purpose of using this defense is to make it so that the other teams strongest player has the
                    least
                    amount of ability to make an impact on the game. This tactic is weak if other players on the
                    opposing
                    team have decent to strong scoring ability, specifically 3-point shooting. This tactic is very niche
                    and
                    shouldn’t be the first option when considering options to beat the opponent.</p>

                <h2>The Undefeatable <br>Triangle Offense</h2>
                <p>Triangle offense is a classical theory of how basketball is to be played. It isn’t as much a offense
                    as
                    it is the fundamental basis for classical basketball. Triangle offense is the basis of spacing the
                    floor, typically 3 players on one side and 2 on the opposite side. The action with the 3 players
                    involves 2 players around the perimeter and 1 player inside the post. Typically, a pass from the top
                    of
                    the key to the other player on the perimeter initiates the sequence. There are multiple options from
                    this pass from a back screen, down screen, or cross screen. These actions are then repeated until a
                    player is open enough to take a shot.</p>
